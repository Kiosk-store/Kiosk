# Kiosk — Multi-Tenant Web Platform for Small Businesses

## Overview

`kiosk` is a multi-tenant web platform built with Next.js 16, React 19, Auth.js v5, and Drizzle ORM PostgreSQL. The platform focuses on high-quality visuals, smooth interactions, and a multi-tenant architecture allowing small businesses to host custom websites, sales funnels, and e-commerce stores on custom subdomains or domains.

## About Kiosk (Multi-Tenant SaaS Platform)

**Kiosk makes it simple for small businesses to get online with dedicated multi-tenant workspaces.**

Most small business owners don't need a complicated website builder. They just need a clean place to show what they offer, share their contact details, and start selling — without spending weeks learning tools or paying high monthly fees.

### Multi-Tenant Capabilities
- **Tenant Workspace Isolation**: Row-level database isolation (`tenants` table) for projects, billing subscriptions, and custom domains.
- **Custom Domains & Subdomains**: Dynamic routing via Next.js Edge Middleware (`business.kiosk.site` or `customdomain.com`).
- **Subscription Packages**:
  - **Landing Page ($20/mo, $192/yr)** — A simple, professional page with business info, contact details, and WhatsApp integration.
  - **Sales Funnel ($30/mo, $288/yr)** — Up to 5 conversion pages with lead capture and CRM integration.
  - **Online Store ($43/mo, $408/yr)** — A full e-commerce store with product catalog, cart, and payment gateways.

Everything is hosted and managed for you. No technical setup. No complicated builders. Just fill in your details and go live.
