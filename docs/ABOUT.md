# About Kiosk

Kiosk is a multi-tenant SaaS platform that makes it simple for small businesses to get online, without making them do the technical work.

**Mission:** Remove the technical barrier between small business owners and a great website by personalizing proven, pre-built pages for them — combining the speed and affordability of templated tools with the polish and hands-on support of a dedicated fulfillment team.

## Core Philosophy: "Done-For-You" Info Submission (No Builder Needed)

A website builder forces the customer to do the heavy lifting: drag-and-drop canvases, choosing columns, tweaking padding, and debugging responsive layouts. That directly contradicts the problem Kiosk solves.

Small business owners choose Kiosk over Wix, Shopify, or Bumpa specifically because they **do not want to sit down and build a website themselves**.

### The Kiosk Workflow:
1. **Submit Info (5 Minutes)**: The business owner fills out a structured intake form (Business Name, Tagline, Story, Offerings/Products, Logo, Brand Photos, Contact, WhatsApp).
2. **Operations Fulfillment & QA**: The Kiosk team reviews submissions in the Admin Studio (`/admin/projects/[id]`), tests links, assigns domains, and clicks **Publish**.
3. **Dynamic Multi-Tenant Rendering**: Visiting `https://<business>.kioosk.online` dynamically pulls the client's persisted data from PostgreSQL and renders a responsive, high-converting live website with 1-click WhatsApp checkout.
4. **Automated Launch Email**: The client receives an automated celebration email with their live link and next-step guides.

**No live builder. No canvas complexity. No steep learning curve.**
